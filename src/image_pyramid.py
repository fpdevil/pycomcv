Description: image_pyramid.py
             Create image pyramid for a supplied image.
An  Image pyramid  is a  multi-scale  representation of  an image.  It
allows  to  find  objects  in  an image  at  different  scales  of  an
image. Combined with the sliding window one can find objects in images
at various locations. At the bottom of the image pyramid, the original
image will  be there at original  size. At each subsequent  layer, the
image  is  resized  and  optionally  smoothed  via  Gaussian  blurring
method. Image  is progressively  subsampled until  a minimum  size has
been reached and no further subsampling is needed.

             Usage:
             python3 image_pyramid.py --image ../images/disney0.jpg
