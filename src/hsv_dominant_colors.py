Description  :
For finding  the dominant colors  of an image by  clustering the colors  in HSV
space.  RGB  space  does  not  preserve the  perspective  distance.  HSV  space
represents  a human  like conception  of color  space. Perspective  distance is
preserved in the HSV cone.

Usage        : python3 --image ../images/skyfall.jpg
